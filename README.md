# GoLedger Challenge

In this challenge you will create a web interface to a blockchain application. In this application you must implement a imdb-like interface, to catalogue TV Shows, with series, seasons, episodes and watchlist registration.

# Requirements

- Your application should be able to add/remove/edit and show all tv shows, seasons, episodes and watchlists;
- Use **React** or **Next.js** (all UI libraries are allowed);

## Instructions

- Fork the repository [https://github.com/goledgerdev/goledger-challenge-web](https://github.com/goledgerdev/goledger-challenge-web)
    - Fork it, do **NOT** clone it, since you will need to send us your forked repository
    - If you **cannot** fork it, create a private repository and give access to `andremacedopv` and `lucas-campelo`.
- Create an web application using React. You will implement the basic operations provided by the API, which are `Create`, `Update`, `Delete` and `Search`.
- Improve your application with a beautiful UI.

## Server

The data are obtained using a rest server at this address: `http://ec2-50-19-36-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com`

Also, a Swagger with the endpoints specifications for the operations is provided at this address: `http://ec2-50-19-36-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/api-docs/index.html`.

Note: The API is protected with Basic Auth. The credentials were sent to you by email.

Tip: execute each operation in the Swagger for information on payload format and endpoint addresses. See examples below.

### Get Schema
Execute a `getSchema` operation to get information on which asset types are available. Don't forget to authenticate with the credentials provided.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://ec2-50-19-36-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/api/query/getSchema" -H "accept: */*" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Execute a getSchema with a payload to get more details on a particula asset.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://ec2-50-19-36-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/api/query/getSchema" -H "accept: */*" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"assetType\":\"tvShows\"}"
```
Tip: the same can be done with transactions, using the `getTx` endpoint.

### Search
Perform a search query on a particular asset type.
```bash
curl -X POST "http://ec2-50-19-36-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com/api/query/search" -H "accept: */*" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"query\":{\"selector\":{\"@assetType\":\"seasons\"}}}"
```
Tip: to read a specific asset, you can use the `readAsset` endpoint.

## Complete the challenge

To complete the challenge, you must send us the link to your forked repository with the code of your application. Please, provide instructions to execute the code.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
